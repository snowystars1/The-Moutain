- Simulates refractions and reflections with the Fresnel effect.
- Only simulates the first refraction (ignores the second refraction).

Not suitable for photo-realistic rendering but enough for casual use.

The shader files ("Pseudo Refraction.shader" and "Pseudo Refraction RGBM.shader")
are dedicated to the public domain. You can use these files as you like.
